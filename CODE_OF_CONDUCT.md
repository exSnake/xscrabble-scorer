# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. A projectâ€™s representation may be further defined and clarified by the project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at cc@exsnake.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Additional details about specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.
